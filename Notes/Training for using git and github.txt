Here i am adding my training and what i am doing to learn more abiout git and github. 

I am pushing my learnings to github every chance i get so i familiarize myself with this all. 

To push changes to git i need to do the following. 
- git add . 
- git commit -m "what i am commiting"
- git push -u origin main

This will pusht he change to the following repository: https://github.com/ZRVT/PythonPractice
which will have all the data i want to learn about there. 

Next i will be practicing doing pull request and merging these in the main branch
This will allow me to better understand how this process goes and further my overal knowledge of programming.

To branch from main first i have to do the following. 

1. Fork from main
git clone https://github.com/ZRVT/PythonPractice

2.  Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-awesome-feature

3. Add and commit changes in git
git add .
git commit -m "Add new awesome feature"

4. Push the branch to github
git push -u origin feature/new-awesome-feature

5. Open the pull request on Github and await review
