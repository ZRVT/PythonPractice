Here i am adding my training and what i am doing to learn more abiout git and github. 

I am pushing my learnings to github every chance i get so i familiarize myself with this all. 

To push changes to git i need to do the following. 
- git add . 
- git commit -m "what i am commiting"
- git push -u origin main

This will pusht he change to the following repository: https://github.com/ZRVT/PythonPractice
which will have all the data i want to learn about there.
