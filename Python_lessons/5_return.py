def cube(num) :
    return num * num * num
# after this return statement i can't add any code

#So the return statement within the python code is used the output of the function

print(cube(3))
# you still need to print it ,like here. 

#WE can also store the output in a variable
result = cube(4)
print(result)
#this will then look nice and cleaner.
